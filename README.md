# GUILAND - Aptos Blockchain Game

A comprehensive blockchain game built on Aptos with guild systems, territory management, NFT equipment, and strategic gameplay mechanics.

## üéÆ Game Overview

GUILAND is a full-stack blockchain game that combines strategic territory control, guild management, and NFT-based equipment systems. Players can create characters, join guilds, conquer territories, and engage in strategic battles while earning resources and building their power.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Architecture (`sources/game_core.move`)

The game is built on a sophisticated Move smart contract with the following core systems:

#### Core Data Structures

```move
// Player character with stats and resources
struct Player has key {
    level: u64,
    experience: u64,
    resources: Resources,
    stats: Stats,
    guild_id: Option<u64>,
    last_battle: u64,
    reputation: u64,
    territories_owned: vector<u64>,
    equipment: vector<u64>,
}

// Guild system with treasury and member management
struct Guild has store, drop, copy {
    id: u64,
    name: String,
    leader: address,
    members: vector<address>,
    treasury: Resources,
    territories: vector<u64>,
    level: u64,
    creation_time: u64,
    tax_rate: u64,
}

// Territory with resource production and defense
struct Territory has store, drop {
    id: u64,
    name: String,
    terrain_type: u8,
    owner: Option<address>,
    guild_id: Option<u64>,
    defense_rating: u64,
    resource_multiplier: u64,
    buildings: SimpleMap<String, u64>,
    last_collected: u64,
}
```

#### Game Mechanics Implementation

**1. Resource System**
- **GUI Tokens**: Primary currency for transactions and guild creation
- **Treats**: Secondary resource for guild contributions
- **Crystals**: Premium resource for equipment enhancement
- **Loyalty Points**: Guild contribution tracking

**2. Character Progression**
- Experience-based leveling system
- Automatic stat point distribution
- Level-based experience requirements
- Reputation system for social interactions

**3. Guild Management**
- Creation cost: 10,000 GUI tokens
- Maximum 100 members per guild
- Treasury system with tax rates (0-15%)
- Territory ownership tracking
- Member management with leader controls

**4. Territory Control**
- 5 initial territories with different terrain types
- Resource production based on time and multipliers
- Defense ratings for battle calculations
- Building system for territory improvements

**5. Battle System**
- Cooldown-based combat (1 hour between battles)
- Stat-based battle calculations with randomness
- Territory defense bonuses
- Resource rewards for victories

**6. NFT Equipment System**
- Rarity-based equipment generation (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
- Enhancement system with success/failure mechanics
- Durability system
- Stat bonuses for character progression

#### Smart Contract Functions

**Player Management**
```move
public entry fun create_player(account: &signer)
public entry fun level_up(account: &signer)
public entry fun collect_resources(account: &signer)
```

**Guild Operations**
```move
public entry fun create_guild(account: &signer, name: String)
public entry fun join_guild(account: &signer, guild_id: u64)
public entry fun contribute_to_guild(account: &signer, gui_amount: u64, treats_amount: u64)
```

**Territory Control**
```move
public entry fun attack_territory(account: &signer, territory_id: u64)
```

**NFT Equipment**
```move
public entry fun mint_equipment(admin: &signer, recipient: address, name: String, item_type: u8, rarity: u8)
public entry fun enhance_equipment(account: &signer, equipment_id: u64)
```

#### State Management

The application uses React hooks for state management with the following patterns:

```typescript
// Game state management
const [player, setPlayer] = useState<Player | null>(null);
const [territories, setTerritories] = useState<Territory[]>([]);
const [guilds, setGuilds] = useState<Guild[]>([]);
const [gameStats, setGameStats] = useState<GameStats | null>(null);

// Loading states
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [isLoadingData, setIsLoadingData] = useState(false);
```
